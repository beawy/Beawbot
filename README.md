# Beawbot
Node.js bot mainly used for functions around the Beawy server. Currently in development.
## Features in the works
- Ask command, gives a randomized and somewhat humourous answer to any question in the world.
- Moderation functions, kicking, banning, warning and role management of users in the server.
- Bandcamp search and play (using the API), TBA
- Music player, using functions similar to RedBot. (YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud etc)
- Logging functions, such as when users join, leave, delete a message in the server. An admin log would seperate deleted messages from a public log.
- Implementing a starred message program, such as a bot would provide like Starboard.
## Downloading the bot onto your server
At this time, Beawbot is still in development and is highly unstable. I haven't even joined it to my own server yet, I've been using Space Boat as an alternative (https://github.com/Votyn/SpaceBoat/). In the future, I will provide a way to install the bot for everyone. When files appear in this repository, I will not provide instructions for them. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any incidents that are caused by Beawbot.
